# Using Wavelet Domain Fingerprints to Improve Source Camera Identification

## Abstract

Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification and
image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be particularly
effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this article, we propose
a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than constructing the
fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet domain fingerprint.
This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising algorithm and allows fin-
gerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet domain. As such, our
modification streamlines the extraction and comparison process. Experimental
results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only achieves
higher detection accuracy but can also significantly improve processing speed
